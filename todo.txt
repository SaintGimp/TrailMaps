Features:
- Search/GOTO
- Support deep links to current engine, location, and zoom (plan for multiple trails)
- "About" page for the app
- "About" page for the trail
- Support touch interface if any of the mapping engines offer that
- Allow users to choose custom colors for sections of the trail
- Offer KML overlays from other sources (snow, fire, etc)
- Include alternate trail routes
- Offer more than one trail
- Allow the user to search for waypoints
- Allow users to add custom waypoints

User stories:
* User can go to waypoints by name (allow partial matches or not?)
- User sees autocomplete waypoint names in search box

To Do on current task:
* Implement server API to look up waypoints by name
- Test text in search box and look up mile marker if number or waypoint if text

Engineering tasks:
- Write a Grunt task that verifies that we have all client tests wired up in Testem
- Implement server-side integration testing
- Here still sometimes gets used before totally loaded
- Requesting bad URL or using bad verb just hangs, need to return 404
- Document components that need to be installed globally (node, mongo, grunt, testem, etc.)
- Figure out how to auto-launch all terminal processes we need for a normal dev session

Future work/research/learning/refactoring
- Check out supertest from the VisionMedia guys
- Minify and concatenate files before deployment
- reduce the size of the trail data sent across the wire - gzip, terse schema, etc.
