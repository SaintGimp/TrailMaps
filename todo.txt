Features:
* Display trail map in three different mapping engines
- "About" page for the app
- "About" page for the trail
- Support deep links to current engine, location, and zoom (plan for multiple trails)
- Support touch interface if any of the mapping engines offer that
- Allow users to choose custom colors for sections of the trail
- Offer KML overlays from other sources (snow, fire, etc)
- Include alternate trail routes
- Offer more than one trail
- Include POIs and other waypoints
- Allow users to add custom waypoints

User stories:
* Can switch between mapping engines keeping location and zoom the same
- Refreshing the page stays on the same engine

Engineering tasks:
* Write client-side tests for existing code
- Run client tests in Grunt
- Standardize on one assert library for server and client (Chai?)
- Write a Grunt task that verifies that we have all client tests wired up in Testem
- Implement server-side integration testing
- Here still sometimes gets used before totally loaded
- Requesting bad URL or using bad verb just hangs, need to return 404
- Mile markers on default zoom seem to have a hiccup at California/Oregon border

To Do on current task:

Future work/research/learning/refactoring
- Check out supertest from the VisionMedia guys
- Look at promises ($.deferred?) for async orchestration
- Minify and concatenate files before deployment
- reduce the size of the trail data sent across the wire - gzip, terse schema, etc.
