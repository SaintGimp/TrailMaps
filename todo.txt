Engineering tasks:
- Write a Grunt task that verifies that we have all client tests wired up in Testem
- Implement server-side integration testing
- Here still sometimes gets used before totally loaded
- Requesting bad URL or using bad verb just hangs, need to return 404
- Document components that need to be installed globally (node, mongo, grunt, testem, etc.)
- Figure out how to auto-launch all terminal processes we need for a normal dev session

Future work/research/learning/refactoring
- Check out supertest from the VisionMedia guys
- Minify and concatenate files before deployment
- reduce the size of the trail data sent across the wire - gzip, terse schema, etc.
