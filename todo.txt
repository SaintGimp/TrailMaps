Features:
* Allow users to add/edit/delete waypoints
- "About" page for the app
- "About" page for the trail
- Nicer error pages (404 and 500), don't show stack traces in production
- Log all errors to a file
- Log all page requests to a file
- Include alternate trail routes
- Support touch interface if any of the mapping engines offer that
- Allow users to choose custom colors for sections of the trail
- Offer KML overlays from other sources (snow, fire, etc)
- Offer more than one trail
- Have an outgoing link to National Weather Service forecast based on current lat/lon
- Add crosshair to show the center of the view
- Make links (optionally?) show a pushpin or similar to show which location was linked
- Enter trail scouting reports with links to photos, locations, and descriptions

User stories:
* User can edit an existing waypoint (I think editing only name, to change lat/long create new waypoint?)
- User can add a new waypoint
- User can sort and filter existing waypoints
- User can sort waypoints by trail mile order
- Admin can audit all waypoint changes
- Waypoints page looks good
- Waypoints page is accessible from the rest of the site

To Do on current task:
* Can we remove the edit button and use only double-click, or does that break on touch interfaces?




Engineering tasks:
- I think Mocha now natively supports promises, right?  If so, switch over to that format.
- The server API to get waypoint by name should probably be get by ID, right? Names are not unique.
- History only works on IE10 not IE9, need shim or graceful degrade
- Google maps get grouchy when not active and browser window is resized
- Write a Grunt task that verifies that we have all client tests wired up in Testem
- Implement server-side integration testing
- Document the components that need to be installed globally (node, mongo, grunt, testem, etc.)
- Figure out how to auto-launch all terminal processes we need for a normal dev session

Future work/research/learning/refactoring
- Check out supertest from the VisionMedia guys
- Minify and concatenate files before deployment
- reduce the size of the trail data sent across the wire - gzip, terse schema, etc.
