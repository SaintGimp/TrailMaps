Engineering tasks:
- History only works on IE10 not IE9, need shim or graceful degrade
- Google maps get grouchy when not active and browser window is resized
- Write a Grunt task that verifies that we have all client tests wired up in Testem
- Implement server-side integration testing
- Document the components that need to be installed globally (node, mongo, grunt, testem, etc.)
- Figure out how to auto-launch all terminal processes we need for a normal dev session

Future work/research/learning/refactoring
- Check out supertest from the VisionMedia guys
- Minify and concatenate files before deployment
- reduce the size of the trail data sent across the wire - gzip, terse schema, etc.
