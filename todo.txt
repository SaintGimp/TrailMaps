Features:
* Display trail map in three different mapping engines
- "About" page for the app
- "About" page for the trail
- Support deep links to current engine, location, and zoom (plan for multiple trails)
- Support touch interface if any of the mapping engines offer that
- Allow users to choose custom colors for sections of the trail
- Offer KML overlays from other sources (snow, fire, etc)
- Include alternate trail routes
- Offer more than one trail
- Include POIs and other waypoints
- Allow users to add custom waypoints

User stories:
* Can switch between mapping engines keeping location and zoom the same
- Refreshing the page stays on the same engine

Engineering tasks:
- Here still sometimes gets used before totally loaded
- When switching tabs, only set loc/zoom if it's different than we want
- Add readme and license
- Implement client-side testing
- Implement server-side integration testing

Future work/research/learning/refactoring
- Check out Lineman.JS at http://searls.testdouble.com/2012/10/13/say-hello-to-lineman/
- Check out Testacular and Test'em
- Checkout supertest from the VisionMedia guys
- Look at promises ($.deferred?) for async orchestration
- Add fades to transitions between engine tabs (breaks Google when I tried the first time)
