    <desc><![CDATA[This data is the product of the PCT Halfmile Project.  It originates in 
          well over a dozen GPS recordings made over time with Garmin handheld GPS units,
          custom built GPS loggers, and survey grade post-processed loggers.  Per-section 
          accuracy varies from 0.6 meter (California L,M,N,O) to 5 meters (e.g, Washington J) 
          to unknown accuracy in other sections.  In general, the error values are low when there 
          is no tree cover and are much higher under trees -- and worst of all when trees are coupled 
          with steep terrain.  All data has been filtered and then reduced for GPS compatibility.
          A few side trails have been created solely by reference to satellite imagery and maps.
          Elevation values are spline-interpolated from many surrounding 1/3 arcsecond 
          USGS DEM grid points and, as such, are NAVD88-based (i.e., they are quasi-MSL).<br/><br/>

          or Lon Cooper &lt;Halfmile@pctmap.net&gt; for all others questions.]]>
