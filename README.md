TrailMaps
=========

Displays a GPS track and mile markers for various long-distance trails, using three different mapping engines to do so.  This allows the user to select the best possible satellite imagery for any given location.

This project is intended to be useful but is mostly a vehicle for me to learn Node.js and Javascript.

Hosted right now at http://trailmaps.ironfoundry.me.
